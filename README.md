## Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

- Playing with computer stuff since my childhood;
- Iâ€™ve finished a technical IT course interlinked with my high school;
- Currently studying Computer Science at [UFABC];
- I like to share knowledge about the area I study;
- Currently working in [Toshokan], a tool that helps in the management of a book collection;
- When I have some free time, I am a contributor in the [Tachiyomi's Extensions] repository.
- If you like any of my projects or contributions, you can make a donation through [PicPay] (Brazil only).
