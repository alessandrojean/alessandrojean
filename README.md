I started to have my fascination by the computing area since I was a child,
when I used to have a Windows 98 PC. Since then, I have never stopped.

I have finished a technical IT course that was interlinked with the high school,
and it was there that I met this wonderful thing called *programming*.

At the moment, I am studying Computer Science at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC).

When I have some free time, I always have the habit of expand my knowledge
by programming and creating things that are useful to my routine.

Sharing knowledge is a thing that I like a lot because I feel good by 
helping and teaching people about the area I study.

I also have a huge hobby related to anime and manga.
